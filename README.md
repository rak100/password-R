# password-R
My first password generator
## In this project I created a new pasword generator.
When user clicks on the generate password button,
series of prompts are presented for password criteria.
The user is asked for its desired password length between 8 and 128 characters,
and whether they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
WHEN all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
